# 4. Bebop (1940s-1950s)

### Historical Context

Emerging during WWII and the 1942-44 recording ban, bebop developed in after-hours jam sessions at clubs like Minton's Playhouse and Monroe's Uptown House in Harlem. Young musicians were pushing against the constraints of swing's commercial dance music, creating a new art form meant for listening rather than dancing.

The context was crucial:
- **WWII era** - Social upheaval and desire for change
- **Recording ban** - Musicians' union strike meant early bebop wasn't documented until 1944-45
- **52nd Street** - New York's jazz club strip where bebop flourished  
- **Small clubs** - Economic changes made small groups more viable than big bands
- **Artistic ambition** - Conscious effort to make jazz "art music" not entertainment

Bebop was also a cultural statement—young, predominantly African American musicians asserting intellectual and artistic sophistication, rejecting the role of entertainer that swing often demanded.

### Relationship to Earlier Styles

Bebop was a revolutionary break from [swing](appendix-b-terminology.md#3-swing--the-big-band-era-1930s-1940s), though built on its foundation:

**From Swing**:
- **Tempo**: Dramatically faster than most swing (often 200+ BPM vs. swing's danceable 120-180)
- **Ensemble size**: Large bands → Small combos (quintet/sextet)
- **Texture**: Arranged sections → Unison melody + individual solos
- **Purpose**: Dance music → Listening music
- **Rhythm section**: Shifted from four-to-the-floor bass drum to [ride cymbal](appendix-b-terminology.md#ride-cymbal-pattern) with [comping](appendix-b-terminology.md#comping) on bass drum/snare
- **Harmony**: Extended swing's vocabulary with [altered dominants](appendix-b-terminology.md#altered-dominants), [tritone substitutions](appendix-b-terminology.md#tritone-substitution), and rapid [ii-V-I progressions](appendix-b-terminology.md#ii-v-i-progression)
- **Melody**: Replaced swing's singable melodies with angular, chromatic [bebop lines](appendix-b-terminology.md#bebop-language) using [eighth-note streams](appendix-b-terminology.md#eighth-note-lines) and [enclosures](appendix-b-terminology.md#enclosures)

**What Bebop Kept**:
- Blues foundation and feeling
- Swing rhythm (though faster and more intense)
- Standard song forms
- Jazz's improvisational essence

**The Revolutionary Shift**: From ensemble music to individual virtuoso expression; from entertainment to art.

### Musical Characteristics

#### Melody & Phrasing (*Theory Introduction*)
- Long, winding eighth-note lines with wide intervallic leaps
- [Bebop scales](appendix-b-terminology.md#bebop-scales) (major, minor, dominant) adding chromatic passing tones between chord tones
- Phrases often starting on upbeats or weak beats
- Heavy use of [chromaticism](appendix-b-terminology.md#chromaticism), [arpeggios](appendix-b-terminology.md#arpeggios), and [approach notes](appendix-b-terminology.md#approach-notes)
- Angular, non-singable melodies designed for instruments, not voice
- [Enclosures](appendix-b-terminology.md#enclosures) - surrounding target notes from above and below

#### Harmony (*Theory Introduction*)
- Complex [chord progressions](appendix-b-terminology.md#chord-progressions) derived from popular songs
- **"Rhythm changes"** - progression from "I Got Rhythm," a bebop standard
- [Reharmonization](appendix-b-terminology.md#reharmonization) of standards with added ii-V progressions
- Frequent use of [diminished](appendix-b-terminology.md#diminished-chords) and [augmented chords](appendix-b-terminology.md#augmented-chords)
- [Tritone substitution](appendix-b-terminology.md#tritone-substitution) - replacing dominant chords
- [Upper structure triads](appendix-b-terminology.md#upper-structure-triads) and [chord extensions](appendix-b-terminology.md#chord-extensions) (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- [Altered dominants](appendix-b-terminology.md#altered-dominants) - ♭9, #9, ♭5, #5 on V7 chords

#### Rhythm (*Theory Introduction*)
- Emphasis on [syncopation](appendix-b-terminology.md#syncopation) and rhythmic displacement
- Bass walking [quarter notes](appendix-b-terminology.md#walking-bass), creating harmonic foundation
- Drummer's ride cymbal keeping steady [swing feel](appendix-b-terminology.md#swing-rhythm) while comp rhythms (bass drum, snare) interact with soloists
- [Trading fours](appendix-b-terminology.md#trading-fours) and [eights](appendix-b-terminology.md#trading-eights) became standard - soloists alternate 4 or 8-bar phrases
- Accents on weak beats, creating rhythmic tension

#### Form
- **Head-solos-head structure**: Theme-improvisation-theme
- [Contrafacts](appendix-b-terminology.md#contrafacts): New melodies over existing chord progressions
  - "Ko-Ko" = "Cherokee" changes
  - "Donna Lee" = "Indiana" changes  
  - "Ornithology" = "How High the Moon" changes
- Standard 32-bar AABA or 12-bar blues forms
- Forms often obscured by continuous eighth-note flow

#### Instrumentation
Typical bebop quintet:
- Trumpet
- Alto or tenor saxophone
- Piano
- Bass
- Drums

Instruments play melody in unison, then solo individually over rhythm section. No arranged backgrounds—pure improvisation over changes.

### Key Musicians

**Charlie Parker (1920-1955)** - Alto Saxophone
The most influential bebop innovator. Revolutionary approach to melody, rhythm, and harmony. Incredible technique combined with deep blues feeling. Every saxophonist and most jazz musicians since have studied Parker.

**Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993)** - Trumpet  
Co-architect of bebop with Parker. Known for virtuosic technique, harmonic sophistication, and fusing Afro-Cuban elements into jazz. Brilliant composer ("A Night in Tunisia," "Salt Peanuts").

**Thelonious Monk (1917-1982)** - Piano/Composer
Unique angular melodies and dissonant harmonic approach. Sparse, percussive piano style. Composed many jazz standards ("Round Midnight," "Straight No Chaser," "Blue Monk"). Sound instantly recognizable.

**Bud Powell (1924-1966)** - Piano
Translated Parker's saxophone lines to piano, establishing bebop piano vocabulary. Right-hand single-note lines with left-hand sparse comping. The template for modern jazz piano.

**Max Roach (1924-2007)** - Drums
Pioneered melodic drumming approach, breaking from swing's timekeeping role. Made drums a fully participating voice in the conversation. Impeccable time and musical intelligence.

**Charles Mingus (1922-1979)** - Bass/Composer
Extended bass role beyond timekeeping to melodic and compositional voice. Though his major work came later, he was active in bebop era.

**Kenny Clarke (1914-1985)** - Drums
"Klook" shifted timekeeping from bass drum to ride cymbal, creating the bebop drumming foundation. Pioneered the modern ride cymbal pattern.

**Dexter Gordon (1923-1990)** - Tenor Saxophone
Brought bebop vocabulary to tenor saxophone with a huge, commanding sound. Influenced everyone from Coltrane to Rollins.

**Fats Navarro (1923-1950)** - Trumpet
Brilliant trumpeter whose warm tone and flowing lines offered an alternative to Gillespie's virtuosic approach. Died tragically young.

**J.J. Johnson (1924-2001)** - Trombone
Proved trombone could play bebop's fast lines. Smooth, precise technique adapted the horn to modern jazz.

### Vocal Traditions

Bebop was primarily instrumental music—its fast tempos and complex melodies didn't lend themselves to singing. However:

**Scat Singing**
- Singers like Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Betty Carter learned to scat bebop lines
- Treated voice as an instrument, improvising with the same vocabulary as horn players
- Often sang lyrics to bebop instrumentals

**Vocalese**
- [Vocalese](appendix-b-terminology.md#vocalese) - Adding lyrics to instrumental jazz solos
- Eddie Jefferson and later Lambert, Hendricks & Ross pioneered this
- Required incredible skill to sing bebop's complex lines

- Influenced fashion (berets, goatees, horn-rimmed glasses, the "hipster" image)
- Associated with Beat Generation writers and intellectuals
- Required formal or informal study—couldn't just "play what you feel"
- Led to development of jazz education and theory systems
- Assertion of African American intellectual and artistic sophistication
- Made improvisation the central focus of jazz
- Created vocabulary and techniques still used by contemporary jazz musicians

### Musical Examples & Practice

#### "Rhythm Changes" Chord Progression
*[Notation to be added]*

The progression from George Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm" became bebop's most common harmonic framework. Hundreds of bebop tunes are built on these changes.

```
A section (8 bars):
| Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 | Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |
or
| Bb | Bdim | Cm7 | F7 | Dm7 | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |

B section (8 bars - "bridge"):
| D7 | D7 | G7 | G7 | C7 | C7 | F7 | F7 |

Full form: A-A-B-A (32 bars total)
```

Tunes built on rhythm changes:
- "Anthropology" (Parker/Gillespie)
- "Oleo" (Sonny Rollins)
- "Moose the Mooche" (Parker)
- "Dexterity" (Parker)

#### Bebop Dominant Scale
*[Notation to be added]*

The bebop dominant scale adds a major 7th (natural 7) to the mixolydian mode, creating a chromatic passing tone between the ♭7 and root. This allows chord tones to consistently fall on downbeats when playing eighth notes.

```
C Bebop Dominant: C - D - E - F - G - A - Bb - B - C
                  1   2   3   4   5   6  b7   7   1
```

Practice pattern: Play ascending and descending over a C7 chord, noticing how chord tones (C-E-G-Bb) align with beats.

#### ii-V-I Progression in Bb
*[Notation to be added]*

The ii-V-I is the fundamental progression in bebop and all modern jazz.

```
| Cm7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Bbmaj7 |
  ii    V     I
```

Common bebop approach:
- Over Cm7: C dorian mode or C bebop minor scale
- Over F7: F bebop dominant scale, altered scale, or diminished scale
- Over Bbmaj7: Bb major scale or Bb bebop major scale

#### "Donna Lee" Opening Phrase
*[Notation to be added]*

The opening 8 bars of Charlie Parker's "Donna Lee" demonstrate classic bebop melodic construction: eighth-note lines, wide intervals, chromatic approach notes, and phrases that outline chord changes clearly.

[Detailed analysis of first phrase to be added]

#### Enclosures
*[Notation to be added]*

Enclosures surround a target note (usually a chord tone) from above and below, either chromatically or diatonically.

Target note: G (5th of C major)
- Chromatic enclosure: Ab - F# - G
- Diatonic enclosure: A - F - G
- Mixed: A - F# - G or Ab - F - G

These create the angular, twisting quality of bebop lines.

### Legacy & Transition

Bebop established the language of modern jazz. Every style that followed either built on bebop (hard bop, modal jazz, post-bop) or reacted against it (cool jazz, free jazz). The harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic vocabulary of bebop remains the foundation of jazz education.

By the late 1940s, some musicians felt bebop's intensity needed balance. On the West Coast, a cooler, more arranged approach was emerging. Simultaneously, musicians were pushing bebop's harmonic complexity even further into what would become hard bop. Jazz was fragmenting into multiple directions, all flowing from bebop's revolutionary fountain.
