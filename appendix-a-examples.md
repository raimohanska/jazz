### Bebop Examples

#### Example 1: "Rhythm Changes" Chord Progression
*[Notation to be added]*

The progression from George Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm" became bebop's most common harmonic framework. Hundreds of bebop tunes are built on these changes.

```
A section (8 bars):
| Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 | Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |
or
| Bb | Bdim | Cm7 | F7 | Dm7 | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |

B section (8 bars - "bridge"):
| D7 | D7 | G7 | G7 | C7 | C7 | F7 | F7 |

Full form: A-A-B-A (32 bars total)
```

Tunes built on rhythm changes:
- "Anthropology" (Parker/Gillespie)
- "Oleo" (Sonny Rollins)
- "Moose the Mooche" (Parker)
- "Dexterity" (Parker)

#### Example 2: Bebop Dominant Scale
*[Notation to be added]*

The bebop dominant scale adds a major 7th (natural 7) to the mixolydian mode, creating a chromatic passing tone between the ♭7 and root. This allows chord tones to consistently fall on downbeats when playing eighth notes.

```
C Bebop Dominant: C - D - E - F - G - A - Bb - B - C
                  1   2   3   4   5   6  b7   7   1
```

Practice pattern: Play ascending and descending over a C7 chord, noticing how chord tones (C-E-G-Bb) align with beats.

#### Example 3: ii-V-I Progression in Bb
*[Notation to be added]*

The ii-V-I is the fundamental progression in bebop and all modern jazz.

```
| Cm7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Bbmaj7 |
  ii    V     I
```

Common bebop approach:
- Over Cm7: C dorian mode or C bebop minor scale
- Over F7: F bebop dominant scale, altered scale, or diminished scale
- Over Bbmaj7: Bb major scale or Bb bebop major scale

#### Example 4: "Donna Lee" Opening Phrase
*[Notation to be added]*

The opening 8 bars of Charlie Parker's "Donna Lee" demonstrate classic bebop melodic construction: eighth-note lines, wide intervals, chromatic approach notes, and phrases that outline chord changes clearly.

#### Example 5: Enclosures
*[Notation to be added]*

Enclosures surround a target note (usually a chord tone) from above and below, either chromatically or diatonically.

Target note: G (5th of C major)
- Chromatic enclosure: Ab - F# - G
- Diatonic enclosure: A - F - G
- Mixed: A - F# - G or Ab - F - G

These create the angular, twisting quality of bebop lines.
