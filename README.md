## Introduction: What Is Jazz?

Defining jazz is like trying to catch water in your hands—the moment you think you've grasped it, it changes form. Over more than a century, jazz has evolved from the streets of New Orleans to concert halls worldwide, from dance music to art music, from acoustic to electric, from tightly arranged to completely free. Yet despite this diversity, certain core elements thread through all its forms.

### The Essential Elements

**Improvisation**
At its heart, jazz is improvised music. While classical musicians interpret a composer's written notes, jazz musicians create new melodies spontaneously. This doesn't mean playing random notes—jazz improvisation draws on deep knowledge of harmony, melody, and rhythm, but the specific notes played in any performance are created in the moment. Even in arranged big band music, space for improvised solos is central.

**Swing Feel**
The word "swing" describes both an era of jazz and a rhythmic feeling that pervades most jazz styles. Swing rhythm creates a propulsive, lilting quality—often described as a "triplet feel" where eighth notes are played unevenly rather than straight. This creates forward momentum and groove. While some modern jazz has explored straight eighth-note feels, the swing concept remains fundamental to the tradition.

**Blues Foundation**
Jazz grew from the blues tradition, and that influence never left. The [blues scale](#blues-scale), [blue notes](#blue-notes) (slightly flattened 3rds, 5ths, and 7ths), and the emotional directness of blues expression infuse all jazz styles. Even the most harmonically complex bebop or the most avant-garde free jazz often returns to blues roots.

**Individual Expression**
Jazz values the individual voice. Two saxophonists can play the same solo transcription, but a jazz musician develops their own sound, phrasing, and approach. This emphasis on personal expression—your tone, your time feel, your harmonic choices—distinguishes jazz from many other musical traditions.

**Interaction and Conversation**
Jazz is collaborative music. Musicians listen and respond to each other in real-time. A rhythm section doesn't just keep time—they react to the soloist, who responds to them in turn. This musical conversation is essential to jazz, whether in a bebop quartet or a big band, in structured forms or free improvisation.

**Rhythm Section Foundation**
Nearly all jazz relies on a rhythm section (typically piano/guitar, bass, and drums) that provides harmonic and rhythmic foundation while also engaging in the musical conversation. The specific roles of these instruments have evolved across jazz history, but their interactive function remains constant.

### What Makes Jazz Different?

**From Classical Music**:
- Improvisation is central rather than exceptional
- Rhythm is flexible, swinging, conversation-based
- Personal sound/expression is cultivated, not standardized
- Written music is often a framework, not a final statement

**From Popular Music**:
- Harmonic and rhythmic complexity
- Extended improvisation
- Individual virtuosity valued
- Artistic expression prioritized over commercial appeal

**From Blues and Folk**:
- Greater harmonic sophistication
- Complex forms and structures
- Emphasis on technical mastery
- Constant evolution and innovation

### A Living Tradition

Jazz is both a historical tradition and a living, evolving art form. Understanding jazz history isn't just academic—each era developed musical vocabulary and approaches that contemporary musicians still draw upon. A modern jazz player might use:
- Blues phrasing from early jazz
- Bebop harmonic concepts from the 1940s
- Modal thinking from the 1960s
- Fusion rhythms from the 1970s
- Contemporary extended techniques

All in a single performance.

### The Journey Ahead

This book traces jazz's evolution chronologically, style by style. You'll see how each era:
- Emerged from specific historical and cultural contexts
- Built upon or reacted against what came before
- Introduced new musical concepts and techniques
- Influenced what followed

You'll learn not just *what* each style sounds like, but *how* it works musically—the scales, chords, rhythms, and forms that create each style's characteristic sound. And you'll discover the artists and recordings that defined each era.

Jazz is a vast, rich tradition. This book is your roadmap. Let's begin where jazz began—with the rhythmic innovations of ragtime and the collective improvisation of early New Orleans.

## Part I: Building Blocks (Theory Integrated with History)

---

## 1. Pre-Jazz & Ragtime (1890s-1910s)

### Historical Context

Before jazz had a name, American music was undergoing a transformation. In the late 19th century, African American musicians were synthesizing African rhythmic traditions with European harmonic and formal structures. This fusion happened across the South, but particularly in cities like New Orleans, St. Louis, and Sedalia, Missouri.

Ragtime emerged in the 1890s, primarily as composed piano music. Published as sheet music and played in saloons, theaters, and homes, ragtime was wildly popular—America's first homegrown popular music to achieve international recognition. Scott Joplin called it "ragged time" referring to its syncopated rhythms that seemed to "rag" (upset) the regular meter.

The era coincided with:
- Post-Reconstruction racial segregation (Jim Crow laws)
- The rise of vaudeville and minstrel shows
- Piano manufacturing boom making instruments more accessible
- Tin Pan Alley's development as music publishing center

### Relationship to Earlier Styles

Ragtime synthesized multiple traditions:

**From African American Music**:
- Syncopated rhythms from banjo playing and African drumming traditions
- Call-and-response patterns
- Percussive approach to piano

**From European Classical Music**:
- March forms (particularly John Philip Sousa's marches)
- Formal compositional structures
- Harmonic language of romantic-era classical music
- Written notation and composition

**From Popular Song**:
- Melodic accessibility
- Song forms (verse/chorus structures)
- Dance rhythms (cakewalk, two-step)

Ragtime was *composed* rather than improvised, distinguishing it from the jazz that would follow. But it established the rhythmic foundation jazz would build upon.

### Musical Characteristics

#### Syncopation (*Theory Introduction*)
The defining characteristic of ragtime is [syncopation](#syncopation)—placing rhythmic emphasis on weak beats or offbeats. On piano, the left hand maintains a steady "oom-pah" or march-like bass pattern in duple meter (usually 2/4), while the right hand plays syncopated melodies that accent unexpected beats.

This creates a delightful tension: the pianist's left hand stays "straight" while the right hand "rags" the rhythm. Example: where you'd expect emphasis on beats 1 and 3, ragtime melodies accent the "and" of 1 and beat 2.

#### Form
Ragtime pieces typically use multi-strain form borrowed from marches:
- Usually 3-4 distinct melodic sections (strains)
- Each strain typically 16 bars
- Pattern like: AA BB A CC DD
- Key changes between sections (often to subdominant)
- Each strain repeated

#### Stride Piano (*Theory Introduction*)
[Stride piano](#stride-piano) evolved from ragtime's left-hand patterns. The pianist's left hand "strides" between:
- Low bass notes or octaves on beats 1 and 3
- Mid-range chords on beats 2 and 4

This creates a strong, propulsive rhythm and fuller harmonic texture than earlier ragtime.

#### Harmony
- Primarily diatonic (staying within major/minor keys)
- Standard classical progressions (I-IV-V-I)
- Some [chromaticism](#chromaticism) for color
- Secondary dominants for modulation between strains
- Simpler than jazz harmony that would follow

#### Melody
- Highly syncopated but clearly structured
- Scalar passages and arpeggios
- Ornamented with grace notes and turns
- Designed to sound difficult but be playable
- Vocal quality despite being instrumental

### Key Musicians

**Scott Joplin (1868-1917)** - Piano/Composer
The "King of Ragtime." Composed sophisticated, refined ragtime and fought to have it recognized as serious artistic music. His works elevated ragtime from popular entertainment to art music.

**James Scott (1885-1938)** - Piano/Composer  
One of the "Big Three" ragtime composers alongside Joplin and Joseph Lamb. Known for sophisticated harmonic progressions and melodic development.

**Joseph Lamb (1887-1960)** - Piano/Composer
The third of the "Big Three." White composer who studied Joplin's work closely. Known for complex, refined compositions.

**Jelly Roll Morton (1890-1941)** - Piano/Composer
Claimed to have "invented jazz in 1902." Bridged ragtime and early jazz, adding improvisation and blues feeling to ragtime structures. His work points toward what was coming.

**Eubie Blake (1887-1983)** - Piano/Composer
Stride pianist who extended ragtime's life into the 1920s. Known for "I'm Just Wild About Harry" and other songs that brought ragtime sensibility to popular song.

**James P. Johnson (1894-1955)** - Piano
"Father of Stride Piano." Developed stride technique that would influence every jazz pianist after him. Composed "The Charleston."

### Essential Recordings

1. **"Maple Leaf Rag"** - Scott Joplin (1899) - The piece that defined ragtime, still the most famous rag ever written
2. **"The Entertainer"** - Scott Joplin (1902) - Perfectly balanced melody and rhythm; later featured in "The Sting"
3. **"Frog Legs Rag"** - James Scott (1906) - Showcases sophisticated harmony and structure
4. **"Solace"** - Scott Joplin (1909) - Lyrical, slower "Mexican serenade" showing ragtime's expressive range
5. **"Ragtime Dance"** - Scott Joplin (1902) - Demonstrates connection between ragtime and dance
6. **"Sensation Rag"** - Joseph Lamb (1908) - Complex composition showing ragtime's artistic maturity
7. **"Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag"** - Jelly Roll Morton (1938) - Morton's improvised version shows the bridge to jazz
8. **"Carolina Shout"** - James P. Johnson (1921) - Stride piano at its finest, test piece for aspiring pianists

*Note: Many ragtime pieces were originally published as sheet music. Modern recordings feature various pianists interpreting these compositions.*

### Cultural Impact

- First distinctly American music to gain international recognition
- Challenged European dominance in serious music
- Created controversy (condemned by some as primitive, celebrated by others as innovative)
- Influenced European classical composers (Debussy, Stravinsky)
- Established piano as central to American popular music
- Created template for syncopation that jazz would expand
- Demonstrated African American musical sophistication during Jim Crow era

### The Bridge to Jazz

While ragtime was primarily composed music played from written scores, it contained seeds of jazz:
- Syncopated rhythms that would become swing
- Pianistic techniques (stride) that jazz would adopt
- Blues-inflected melodies
- Individual expression within composed frameworks

By the 1910s, musicians in New Orleans were taking ragtime's rhythmic innovations and adding something new: collective improvisation. The jazz age was beginning.

## 2. New Orleans Jazz & Dixieland (1910s-1930s)

### Historical Context

New Orleans in the early 20th century was unlike anywhere else in America. As a port city with Caribbean, African American, Creole, French, Spanish, and Anglo cultures mixing, it was a musical melting pot. The city's unique social structure—including the Creole population with classical music training—created perfect conditions for jazz to emerge.

Jazz developed in multiple contexts:
- **Storyville** - The legal red-light district where musicians worked in saloons and dance halls
- **Brass Bands** - Funeral processions and parades where collective improvisation evolved
- **Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs** - African American community organizations that sponsored musical events
- **Riverboats** - Mississippi River steamboats employed bands for entertainment

The music that emerged was initially called "jass" or simply "hot music"—the term "jazz" didn't standardize until the music spread north. When Storyville closed in 1917, many musicians migrated to Chicago, Kansas City, and New York, spreading the New Orleans sound.

### Relationship to Earlier Styles

New Orleans jazz took elements from multiple sources and transformed them:

**From Ragtime**:
- Syncopated rhythms and march-like structures
- But added: collective improvisation instead of composed parts

**From Blues**:
- Blues scales, blue notes, and emotional expression
- Call-and-response patterns
- But added: ensemble interplay and more complex harmony

**From Brass Band Traditions**:
- Instrumentation (trumpets, trombones, clarinets)
- Parade rhythms and marching feel
- But added: improvisation and swing feel

**From European Classical**:
- (Via Creole musicians) technical facility and harmonic knowledge
- Formal training on instruments
- But added: African rhythmic sensibility and improvisation

**The Revolutionary Innovation**: Multiple musicians improvising simultaneously while maintaining coherent collective sound. This [collective improvisation](#collective-improvisation) was unprecedented.

### Musical Characteristics

#### Collective Improvisation (*Theory Introduction*)
Unlike ragtime's composed melodies or later jazz's emphasis on individual soloists, New Orleans jazz featured simultaneous group improvisation. Three melodic instruments played distinct roles:

- **Trumpet/Cornet**: Carried the main melody or "lead"
- **Clarinet**: Wove intricate countermelodies around the lead, often in higher register
- **Trombone**: Provided bass line and harmonic foundation with sliding, vocal-like lines

All three improvised their parts simultaneously, creating dense, joyous polyphony. The magic was making it sound coherent rather than chaotic.

#### Rhythm Section
- **Piano** or **Banjo**: Strummed chords on all four beats or played stride patterns
- **Tuba** or **Bass**: Played on beats 1 and 3 (not yet [walking bass](#walking-bass) lines)
- **Drums**: Kept time with march-like patterns, often emphasizing all four beats

The rhythm was energetic but more "on the beat" than later swing—a "two-beat feel" or [2/2 time](#two-beat-feel).

#### Blues Form (*Theory Introduction*)
The [12-bar blues](#twelve-bar-blues) became a standard form:
- 12 measures following I-I-I-I / IV-IV-I-I / V-IV-I-I progression
- Each instrument improvises within this harmonic framework
- Structure simple enough for collective improvisation
- Blues scale and blue notes provide melodic material

#### Other Common Forms
- 32-bar song forms (AABA)
- 16-bar structures
- Verse-chorus formats
- Often adapted from popular songs or hymns

#### Harmony
- Mostly diatonic with simple I-IV-V progressions
- Some secondary dominants
- Occasional [chromaticism](#chromaticism)
- Simpler than bebop, but more adventurous than ragtime

#### Melody & Phrasing
- Based on blues scales and major scales
- Heavy use of [blue notes](#blue-notes) (♭3, ♭5, ♭7)
- Short, repeated melodic phrases (riffs)
- Call-and-response between sections
- Vocal quality—instruments "talked" and "sang"

### Key Musicians

**Buddy Bolden (1877-1931)** - Cornet
Legendary figure who never recorded. Credited with developing the hot, blues-inflected sound that defined early jazz. His powerful, emotionally direct playing influenced everyone who followed.

**Jelly Roll Morton (1890-1941)** - Piano/Composer/Bandleader
Bridged ragtime and jazz. Claimed to have "invented jazz in 1902" (an exaggeration, but he was certainly there early). Brilliant composer who carefully arranged ensemble parts while leaving room for improvisation.

**King Oliver (1885-1938)** - Cornet/Bandleader
Leader of the Creole Jazz Band, the first great jazz ensemble to record extensively. Master of muted cornet playing and blues expression. Mentored Louis Armstrong.

**Louis Armstrong (1901-1971)** - Trumpet/Vocals
The most important figure in jazz history. Revolutionized the music by emphasizing individual solo improvisation over collective improvisation. Extraordinary technique, rhythmic sophistication, and emotional depth. His influence extends through every era of jazz.

**Sidney Bechet (1897-1959)** - Soprano Saxophone/Clarinet
First major saxophonist in jazz. Powerful, wide vibrato and passionate playing. Rival to Armstrong in virtuosity and influence.

**Johnny Dodds (1892-1940)** - Clarinet
Definitive New Orleans clarinetist. Blues-drenched tone and inventive improvisation.

**Kid Ory (1886-1973)** - Trombone
Developed the tailgate trombone style—rhythmic, sliding bass lines that propelled the ensemble.

**Original Dixieland Jazz Band** - Group
First jazz group to make recordings (1917), though not the best or most authentic. White musicians who popularized the music commercially and gave "jazz" its name.

### Vocal Traditions

**Blues Singers**
Female blues singers like **Ma Rainey** and **Bessie Smith** worked alongside jazz musicians, with jazz instrumentation backing their vocals. Their phrasing, use of blue notes, and emotional directness influenced instrumental players.

**Louis Armstrong's Vocals**
Armstrong's singing was as influential as his trumpet playing—natural, rhythmic, improvisational. His [scat singing](#scat-singing) (vocal improvisation using nonsense syllables) became a jazz staple.

### Essential Recordings

1. **"Dippermouth Blues"** - King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band (1923) - Classic collective improvisation; Oliver's muted solo is legendary
2. **"West End Blues"** - Louis Armstrong (1928) - Armstrong's opening cadenza changed jazz forever; shift from collective to solo improvisation
3. **"Potato Head Blues"** - Louis Armstrong's Hot Seven (1927) - Stop-time breaks showcase Armstrong's rhythmic genius
4. **"Black Bottom Stomp"** - Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers (1926) - Perfect balance of composition and improvisation
5. **"Livery Stable Blues"** - Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1917) - First jazz recording, historically significant despite limitations
6. **"Dead Man Blues"** - Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers (1926) - Sophisticated arrangement demonstrating Morton's compositional gifts
7. **"Muskrat Ramble"** - Louis Armstrong's Hot Five (1926) - Quintessential New Orleans jazz structure and spirit
8. **"St. Louis Blues"** - Bessie Smith with Louis Armstrong (1925) - Blues vocalist and jazz instrumentalist in perfect dialogue

### Cultural Impact

- Established improvisation as central to American music
- Created first truly American art music
- Demonstrated African American musical innovation during segregation
- Launched jazz's spread across America and worldwide
- Created template for small group jazz (rhythm section + horns)
- Influenced dance crazes (Charleston, Black Bottom)
- Generated moral panic and controversy about "wild" music

### The Transition Ahead

By the late 1920s, jazz was evolving rapidly. Louis Armstrong's recordings with the Hot Five and Hot Seven demonstrated the power of individual solo improvisation. As jazz moved north and became more commercial, it would transform from New Orleans collective improvisation into the arranged big band swing of the 1930s. The intimate, polyphonic conversation of New Orleans jazz would give way to section-based arrangements and featured soloists, but the foundation—blues feeling, swing rhythm, and improvisational spirit—would remain.

---

## 3. Swing & the Big Band Era (1930s-1940s)

### Historical Context

The swing era was jazz's popular music golden age. From roughly 1935-1946, big band swing dominated American culture—it was dance music, pop music, and America's soundtrack. Bands led by Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and others played ballrooms, theaters, and radio broadcasts to massive audiences.

Several factors created this phenomenon:
- **The Great Depression** (1929-1939) - People needed escape; dance halls offered affordable entertainment
- **Prohibition's end** (1933) - Nightclubs reopened legally, hiring more musicians
- **Radio broadcasting** - Bands reached national audiences; live broadcasts from ballrooms created stars
- **Recording technology** - Improved fidelity made records more appealing
- **Migration** - African Americans moving north brought jazz to new audiences

The era peaked in the late 1930s and early 1940s. World War II (1941-1945) initially boosted band popularity (soldiers wanted to dance), but wartime restrictions, the 1942-44 recording ban, and changing tastes led to swing's commercial decline by 1946.

### Relationship to Earlier Styles

Swing represented a fundamental shift from New Orleans jazz:

**From New Orleans/Dixieland**:
- Small groups (5-7 pieces) → Large ensembles (12-25 pieces)
- Collective improvisation → Arranged section writing with featured soloists
- Polyphonic texture → Homophonic (melody with accompaniment) and call-and-response
- Loose, variable forms → Tightly arranged compositions
- But kept: blues feeling, improvisational spirit, swing rhythm

**New Elements**:
- **Arranged music**: Written parts for sections (saxophones, trumpets, trombones)
- **Riff-based composition**: Simple melodic phrases repeated and layered
- **Swing rhythm refined**: More sophisticated, propulsive [swing feel](#swing-rhythm)
- **Virtuosic soloists**: Featured improvisers within arrangements
- **Song form emphasis**: 32-bar AABA structures from Tin Pan Alley

### Musical Characteristics

#### Swing Rhythm (*Theory Introduction*)
The [swing rhythm](#swing-rhythm) that gives the era its name is a specific rhythmic feel:
- Eighth notes played unevenly (roughly 2:1 ratio, like a triplet with first two notes tied)
- Creates lilting, propulsive forward motion
- "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing" (Duke Ellington)
- Not strictly quantifiable—a feeling musicians internalize

#### Big Band Instrumentation
Standard big band (circa 1940):
- **Saxophones**: 5 players (2 altos, 2 tenors, 1 baritone)
- **Trumpets**: 4 players  
- **Trombones**: 3-4 players (sometimes including bass trombone)
- **Rhythm Section**: Piano, guitar, bass, drums

Total: 15-18 musicians

#### Section Writing & Arrangement (*Theory Introduction*)
[Arrangers](#arranging) wrote parts creating distinct textures:
- **Soli sections**: All instruments in a section playing in harmony (like saxophone soli)
- **Call-and-response**: One section "calls," another "responds"
- **Riff patterns**: Short, repeated melodic phrases passed between sections
- **Shout chorus**: Final chorus at peak energy, all sections playing
- **Background figures**: Sections playing behind soloist

Great arrangers (Fletcher Henderson, Don Redman, Eddie Sauter) were as important as bandleaders.

#### Rhythm Section Evolution
Major changes from New Orleans style:
- **Bass**: [Walking bass](#walking-bass) lines—playing all four beats, outlining chord changes
- **Drums**: Hi-hat on 2 and 4, ride cymbal for swing feel, bass drum for accents
- **Guitar**: Strummed chords on all four beats (Freddie Green style) or [comping](#comping)
- **Piano**: [Comping](#comping) (playing chords rhythmically) behind soloists, or playing written parts

Created the [four-beat feel](#four-beat-feel) that propelled dancers.

#### Form
- 32-bar AABA song form (most common)
- 12-bar blues
- Head arrangements: loosely organized around repeated riffs
- Typical structure: intro, ensemble passages, solo sections, shout chorus, ending

#### Harmony
- Diatonic progressions from popular songs
- [ii-V-I progressions](#ii-v-i-progression) becoming standard
- Some extended chords (6ths, 9ths)
- Secondary dominants
- More sophisticated than New Orleans jazz, but simpler than bebop to come

#### Melody
- Singable melodies (many were popular songs)
- Riff-based themes (Count Basie specialty)
- Arranged harmonizations of melodies
- Solo improvisations becoming more linear and flowing

### Key Musicians & Bandleaders

**Duke Ellington (1899-1974)** - Piano/Composer/Bandleader
The most important composer in jazz history. Used his orchestra as his instrument, writing for individual players' specific sounds. Elevated jazz to concert music while maintaining swing and blues roots. Composer of thousands of pieces including "Mood Indigo," "Sophisticated Lady," "Take the A Train."

**Count Basie (1904-1984)** - Piano/Bandleader
Master of the blues-based, riff-driven swing. His band's rhythm section (the "All-American Rhythm Section") set the standard for swing feel. Economical piano style—"less is more." Bands remained vital for 50 years.

**Benny Goodman (1909-1986)** - Clarinet/Bandleader
"The King of Swing." Virtuoso clarinetist who brought jazz to white mainstream audiences. His 1938 Carnegie Hall concert legitimized jazz as art music. Racially integrated his groups (controversial for the time).

**Fletcher Henderson (1897-1952)** - Piano/Arranger/Bandleader
Pioneer of big band arranging. His arrangements (many later sold to Goodman) established the section-based, call-and-response approach that defined swing.

**Coleman Hawkins (1904-1969)** - Tenor Saxophone
First great jazz saxophonist. Developed full, harmonically sophisticated approach to the instrument. His 1939 recording of "Body and Soul" is a masterpiece.

**Lester Young (1909-1959)** - Tenor Saxophone
Cool, light tone contrasting with Hawkins's robust sound. Melodic, lyrical approach influenced all who followed, especially Charlie Parker. Played with Count Basie.

**Billie Holiday (1915-1959)** - Vocals
Most influential jazz singer. Incredibly subtle phrasing, treating voice as an instrument. Turned pop songs into jazz art through her interpretive genius.

**Ella Fitzgerald (1917-1996)** - Vocals
"First Lady of Song." Perfect pitch, extraordinary range, virtuosic scat singing. Began with Chick Webb's band.

**Jimmie Lunceford (1902-1947)** - Bandleader/Saxophonist
Led one of the most exciting, innovative swing bands. Known for precise, showmanship-oriented arrangements.

**Chick Webb (1905-1939)** - Drums/Bandleader
Pioneering drummer and bandleader. Despite physical disabilities, his powerful drumming drove one of Harlem's greatest bands.

**Artie Shaw (1910-2004)** - Clarinet/Bandleader
Virtuoso clarinetist, rival to Goodman. More experimental, incorporated strings and unusual instrumentation.

### Vocal Traditions

The swing era was jazz's most vocal-friendly period. Singers were featured members of bands:

**Big Band Vocalists**
- Singers like Frank Sinatra (with Tommy Dorsey), Billie Holiday (with Basie, Goodman, others), and Ella Fitzgerald (with Chick Webb) were integrated into arrangements
- Vocalists interpreted popular songs with jazz feeling
- Often scatted or improvised around melodies

**Vocal Style Characteristics**
- Swing phrasing matching instrumental approaches
- Behind or ahead of the beat for emotional effect
- Subtle pitch manipulation (like blue notes)
- Conversational, intimate delivery (aided by microphone technology)

### Essential Recordings

1. **"One O'Clock Jump"** - Count Basie Orchestra (1937) - Definitive riff-based swing; the Basie rhythm section
2. **"Sing, Sing, Sing"** - Benny Goodman Orchestra (1937) - Extended drum feature by Gene Krupa; peak swing excitement
3. **"Take the 'A' Train"** - Duke Ellington Orchestra (1941) - Ellington's theme song; Billy Strayhorn composition
4. **"In the Mood"** - Glenn Miller Orchestra (1939) - Most commercially successful swing recording
5. **"Body and Soul"** - Coleman Hawkins (1939) - Saxophone ballad improvisation at its finest

8. **"Strange Fruit"** - Billie Holiday (1939) - Haunting protest song; Holiday's interpretive power
9. **"A-Tisket, A-Tasket"** - Ella Fitzgerald with Chick Webb (1938) - Joyful swing vocal
10. **"Cherokee"** - Charlie Barnet Orchestra (1939) - Complex harmony that beboppers would mine

### Cultural Impact

- Jazz's commercial and cultural peak—truly America's popular music
- Launched celebrity culture around bandleaders and singers
- Dance crazes (Lindy Hop, Jitterbug) tied to the music
- Broke down some racial barriers (integrated bands, mixed audiences)
- Provided soundtrack for WWII (boosting morale, USO shows)
- Created recording industry boom
- Established jazz as sophisticated, complex music
- Launched careers of singers who would dominate 1940s-50s pop

### The Seeds of Change

By the mid-1940s, younger musicians were growing restless with swing's constraints:
- Arrangements felt restrictive to creative players
- Commercial demands limited experimentation
- Danceable tempos and singable melodies felt limiting
- Musicians wanted more harmonic and rhythmic complexity

In after-hours jam sessions, players like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk were experimenting with faster tempos, complex harmonies, and a new approach. The bebop revolution was beginning.

## Part II: The Bebop Revolution & Its Descendants

---

## 4. Bebop (1940s-1950s)

### Historical Context

Emerging during WWII and the 1942-44 recording ban, bebop developed in after-hours jam sessions at clubs like Minton's Playhouse and Monroe's Uptown House in Harlem. Young musicians were pushing against the constraints of swing's commercial dance music, creating a new art form meant for listening rather than dancing.

The context was crucial:
- **WWII era** - Social upheaval and desire for change
- **Recording ban** - Musicians' union strike meant early bebop wasn't documented until 1944-45
- **52nd Street** - New York's jazz club strip where bebop flourished  
- **Small clubs** - Economic changes made small groups more viable than big bands
- **Artistic ambition** - Conscious effort to make jazz "art music" not entertainment

Bebop was also a cultural statement—young, predominantly African American musicians asserting intellectual and artistic sophistication, rejecting the role of entertainer that swing often demanded.

### Relationship to Earlier Styles

Bebop was a revolutionary break from [swing](#3-swing--the-big-band-era-1930s-1940s), though built on its foundation:

**From Swing**:
- **Tempo**: Dramatically faster than most swing (often 200+ BPM vs. swing's danceable 120-180)
- **Ensemble size**: Large bands → Small combos (quintet/sextet)
- **Texture**: Arranged sections → Unison melody + individual solos
- **Purpose**: Dance music → Listening music
- **Rhythm section**: Shifted from four-to-the-floor bass drum to [ride cymbal](#ride-cymbal-pattern) with [comping](#comping) on bass drum/snare
- **Harmony**: Extended swing's vocabulary with [altered dominants](#altered-dominants), [tritone substitutions](#tritone-substitution), and rapid [ii-V-I progressions](#ii-v-i-progression)
- **Melody**: Replaced swing's singable melodies with angular, chromatic [bebop lines](#bebop-language) using [eighth-note streams](#eighth-note-lines) and [enclosures](#enclosures)

**What Bebop Kept**:
- Blues foundation and feeling
- Swing rhythm (though faster and more intense)
- Standard song forms
- Jazz's improvisational essence

**The Revolutionary Shift**: From ensemble music to individual virtuoso expression; from entertainment to art.

### Musical Characteristics

#### Melody & Phrasing (*Theory Introduction*)
- Long, winding eighth-note lines with wide intervallic leaps
- [Bebop scales](#bebop-scales) (major, minor, dominant) adding chromatic passing tones between chord tones
- Phrases often starting on upbeats or weak beats
- Heavy use of [chromaticism](#chromaticism), [arpeggios](#arpeggios), and [approach notes](#approach-notes)
- Angular, non-singable melodies designed for instruments, not voice
- [Enclosures](#enclosures) - surrounding target notes from above and below

#### Harmony (*Theory Introduction*)
- Complex [chord progressions](#chord-progressions) derived from popular songs
- **"Rhythm changes"** - progression from "I Got Rhythm," a bebop standard
- [Reharmonization](#reharmonization) of standards with added ii-V progressions
- Frequent use of [diminished](#diminished-chords) and [augmented chords](#augmented-chords)
- [Tritone substitution](#tritone-substitution) - replacing dominant chords
- [Upper structure triads](#upper-structure-triads) and [chord extensions](#chord-extensions) (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- [Altered dominants](#altered-dominants) - ♭9, #9, ♭5, #5 on V7 chords

#### Rhythm (*Theory Introduction*)
- Emphasis on [syncopation](#syncopation) and rhythmic displacement
- Bass walking [quarter notes](#walking-bass), creating harmonic foundation
- Drummer's ride cymbal keeping steady [swing feel](#swing-rhythm) while comp rhythms (bass drum, snare) interact with soloists
- [Trading fours](#trading-fours) and [eights](#trading-eights) became standard - soloists alternate 4 or 8-bar phrases
- Accents on weak beats, creating rhythmic tension

#### Form
- **Head-solos-head structure**: Theme-improvisation-theme
- [Contrafacts](#contrafacts): New melodies over existing chord progressions
  - "Ko-Ko" = "Cherokee" changes
  - "Donna Lee" = "Indiana" changes  
  - "Ornithology" = "How High the Moon" changes
- Standard 32-bar AABA or 12-bar blues forms
- Forms often obscured by continuous eighth-note flow

#### Instrumentation
Typical bebop quintet:
- Trumpet
- Alto or tenor saxophone
- Piano
- Bass
- Drums

Instruments play melody in unison, then solo individually over rhythm section. No arranged backgrounds—pure improvisation over changes.

### Key Musicians

**Charlie Parker (1920-1955)** - Alto Saxophone
The most influential bebop innovator. Revolutionary approach to melody, rhythm, and harmony. Incredible technique combined with deep blues feeling. Every saxophonist and most jazz musicians since have studied Parker.

**Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993)** - Trumpet  
Co-architect of bebop with Parker. Known for virtuosic technique, harmonic sophistication, and fusing Afro-Cuban elements into jazz. Brilliant composer ("A Night in Tunisia," "Salt Peanuts").

**Thelonious Monk (1917-1982)** - Piano/Composer
Unique angular melodies and dissonant harmonic approach. Sparse, percussive piano style. Composed many jazz standards ("Round Midnight," "Straight No Chaser," "Blue Monk"). Sound instantly recognizable.

**Bud Powell (1924-1966)** - Piano
Translated Parker's saxophone lines to piano, establishing bebop piano vocabulary. Right-hand single-note lines with left-hand sparse comping. The template for modern jazz piano.

**Max Roach (1924-2007)** - Drums
Pioneered melodic drumming approach, breaking from swing's timekeeping role. Made drums a fully participating voice in the conversation. Impeccable time and musical intelligence.

**Charles Mingus (1922-1979)** - Bass/Composer
Extended bass role beyond timekeeping to melodic and compositional voice. Though his major work came later, he was active in bebop era.

**Kenny Clarke (1914-1985)** - Drums
"Klook" shifted timekeeping from bass drum to ride cymbal, creating the bebop drumming foundation. Pioneered the modern ride cymbal pattern.

**Dexter Gordon (1923-1990)** - Tenor Saxophone
Brought bebop vocabulary to tenor saxophone with a huge, commanding sound. Influenced everyone from Coltrane to Rollins.

**Fats Navarro (1923-1950)** - Trumpet
Brilliant trumpeter whose warm tone and flowing lines offered an alternative to Gillespie's virtuosic approach. Died tragically young.

**J.J. Johnson (1924-2001)** - Trombone
Proved trombone could play bebop's fast lines. Smooth, precise technique adapted the horn to modern jazz.

### Vocal Traditions

Bebop was primarily instrumental music—its fast tempos and complex melodies didn't lend themselves to singing. However:

**Scat Singing**
- Singers like Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Betty Carter learned to scat bebop lines
- Treated voice as an instrument, improvising with the same vocabulary as horn players
- Often sang lyrics to bebop instrumentals

**Vocalese**
- [Vocalese](#vocalese) - Adding lyrics to instrumental jazz solos
- Eddie Jefferson and later Lambert, Hendricks & Ross pioneered this
- Required incredible skill to sing bebop's complex lines

### Essential Recordings

1. **"Ko-Ko"** - Charlie Parker (1945) - Blazing tempo, [contrafact](#contrafacts) on "Cherokee"; definitive bebop
2. **"Salt Peanuts"** - Dizzy Gillespie (1945) - Playful melody, virtuosic solos; bebop joy
3. **"A Night in Tunisia"** - Dizzy Gillespie (1946) - Exotic harmony, Afro-Cuban influence; Gillespie masterpiece
4. **"Ornithology"** - Charlie Parker (1946) - Contrafact on "How High the Moon"; classic changes
5. **"'Round Midnight"** - Thelonious Monk (1947) - Haunting ballad, complex harmony; most recorded jazz standard
6. **"Donna Lee"** - Charlie Parker (1947) - Intricate melody showcasing bebop language
7. **"Anthropology"** - Charlie Parker & Dizzy Gillespie (1948) - Classic rhythm changes; Parker and Diz together
8. **"Un Poco Loco"** - Bud Powell (1951) - Piano trio at its peak; Powell's genius on display
9. **"Cherokee"** - Charlie Parker (1942/Live) - The original changes; hear how fast Parker thought
10. **"Groovin' High"** - Dizzy Gillespie (1945) - [Reharmonization](#reharmonization) of "Whispering"; trumpet brilliance

### Cultural Impact

- Established jazz as an art music requiring serious study
- Created divide between commercial and artistic jazz that persists today
- Influenced fashion (berets, goatees, horn-rimmed glasses, the "hipster" image)
- Associated with Beat Generation writers and intellectuals
- Required formal or informal study—couldn't just "play what you feel"
- Led to development of jazz education and theory systems
- Assertion of African American intellectual and artistic sophistication
- Made improvisation the central focus of jazz
- Created vocabulary and techniques still used by contemporary jazz musicians

### Legacy & Transition

Bebop established the language of modern jazz. Every style that followed either built on bebop (hard bop, modal jazz, post-bop) or reacted against it (cool jazz, free jazz). The harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic vocabulary of bebop remains the foundation of jazz education.

By the late 1940s, some musicians felt bebop's intensity needed balance. On the West Coast, a cooler, more arranged approach was emerging. Simultaneously, musicians were pushing bebop's harmonic complexity even further into what would become hard bop. Jazz was fragmenting into multiple directions, all flowing from bebop's revolutionary fountain.

## Appendix A: Musical Examples & Analysis

### Bebop Examples

#### Example 1: "Rhythm Changes" Chord Progression
*[Notation to be added]*

The progression from George Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm" became bebop's most common harmonic framework. Hundreds of bebop tunes are built on these changes.

```
A section (8 bars):
| Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 | Bb | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |
or
| Bb | Bdim | Cm7 | F7 | Dm7 | G7 | Cm7 | F7 |

B section (8 bars - "bridge"):
| D7 | D7 | G7 | G7 | C7 | C7 | F7 | F7 |

Full form: A-A-B-A (32 bars total)
```

Tunes built on rhythm changes:
- "Anthropology" (Parker/Gillespie)
- "Oleo" (Sonny Rollins)
- "Moose the Mooche" (Parker)
- "Dexterity" (Parker)

#### Example 2: Bebop Dominant Scale
*[Notation to be added]*

The bebop dominant scale adds a major 7th (natural 7) to the mixolydian mode, creating a chromatic passing tone between the ♭7 and root. This allows chord tones to consistently fall on downbeats when playing eighth notes.

```
C Bebop Dominant: C - D - E - F - G - A - Bb - B - C
                  1   2   3   4   5   6  b7   7   1
```

Practice pattern: Play ascending and descending over a C7 chord, noticing how chord tones (C-E-G-Bb) align with beats.

#### Example 3: ii-V-I Progression in Bb
*[Notation to be added]*

The ii-V-I is the fundamental progression in bebop and all modern jazz.

```
| Cm7 | F7 | Bbmaj7 | Bbmaj7 |
  ii    V     I
```

Common bebop approach:
- Over Cm7: C dorian mode or C bebop minor scale
- Over F7: F bebop dominant scale, altered scale, or diminished scale
- Over Bbmaj7: Bb major scale or Bb bebop major scale

#### Example 4: "Donna Lee" Opening Phrase
*[Notation to be added]*

The opening 8 bars of Charlie Parker's "Donna Lee" demonstrate classic bebop melodic construction: eighth-note lines, wide intervals, chromatic approach notes, and phrases that outline chord changes clearly.

[Detailed analysis of first phrase to be added]

#### Example 5: Enclosures
*[Notation to be added]*

Enclosures surround a target note (usually a chord tone) from above and below, either chromatically or diatonically.

Target note: G (5th of C major)
- Chromatic enclosure: Ab - F# - G
- Diatonic enclosure: A - F - G
- Mixed: A - F# - G or Ab - F - G

These create the angular, twisting quality of bebop lines.

### Additional Examples

[*To be continued for each style - blues progressions, modal vamps, Latin rhythms, fusion grooves, etc.*]

---

## Appendix B: Complete Terminology & Concepts Reference

### A

#### Altered Dominants
Dominant seventh chords with altered 5ths and/or 9ths (b5, #5, b9, #9). Common in bebop and later styles. Example: G7#5#9 in a ii-V-I progression. Creates tension resolving to the I chord.

#### Approach Notes
Notes that lead into a target note (usually a chord tone) by stepwise motion from above, below, or both. Creates melodic interest and emphasizes important notes. Common in bebop lines.

#### Arpeggios
Playing the notes of a chord sequentially rather than simultaneously. In jazz, often extended to include 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. Fundamental building block of jazz improvisation.

#### Augmented Chords
Chords with a raised (augmented) 5th. Symbol: C+ or Caug. Notes: C-E-G#. Creates tension; common in bebop and later styles. Symmetrical - any note can function as the root.

### B

#### Bebop Language
The characteristic melodic vocabulary developed in the 1940s featuring eighth-note lines, chromatic approach notes, enclosures, and chord-tone oriented improvisation. Foundation for all modern jazz.

#### Bebop Scales
Scales with added chromatic passing tones that place chord tones on downbeats when playing continuous eighth notes:
- **Bebop dominant**: Mixolydian + major 7th
- **Bebop major**: Major scale + #5  
- **Bebop minor**: Dorian + major 3rd

#### Blue Notes
Notes played or sung slightly flat (or with expressive pitch variation) in blues and jazz. Primarily the ♭3, ♭5, and ♭7. Not exactly the tempered minor intervals—somewhere between major and minor. Core of blues expression.

#### Blues Scale
Six-note scale: 1 - ♭3 - 4 - ♭5 - 5 - ♭7. Combines minor pentatonic with added ♭5 ("blue note"). Foundation of blues and jazz melody. Example in C: C - Eb - F - Gb - G - Bb.

### C

#### Chord Extensions
Notes added above the basic triad or seventh chord: 9ths, 11ths, 13ths. Common in jazz harmony. Example: Cmaj9 = C-E-G-B-D. Creates richer, more colorful harmony.

#### Chord Progressions
Sequence of chords. Jazz uses progressions from:
- Blues (12-bar blues)
- Popular songs (ii-V-I, rhythm changes, standards)
- Original compositions
- Modal vamps (static or slow-moving)

#### Chromaticism
Use of notes outside the diatonic scale. Creates tension, color, and movement. Extensive chromaticism distinguishes bebop from swing. Includes chromatic approach notes, altered chords, and chromatic voice leading.

#### Collective Improvisation
Simultaneous improvisation by multiple musicians, each with a distinct role. Defining characteristic of New Orleans jazz (trumpet lead, clarinet countermelody, trombone bass line). Revisited in free jazz but with different approach.

#### Comping
Short for "accompanying." Rhythmic chord playing behind a soloist, typically by piano or guitar. Responds to and interacts with the soloist. Essential skill for rhythm section players.

#### Contrafacts
New melodies composed over existing chord progressions. Common in bebop as way to avoid paying royalties while using familiar changes. Examples:
- "Ko-Ko" over "Cherokee"
- "Ornithology" over "How High the Moon"
- "Anthropology" over "I Got Rhythm"

### D

#### Diminished Chords
Chords built from stacked minor 3rds. **Diminished 7th**: C-Eb-Gb-Bbb (enharmonic with A). Symmetrical—every note can function as root. Common as passing chords in bebop. Tense, unstable quality resolves to stable chords.

### E

#### Eighth-Note Lines
Continuous streams of eighth notes, the primary texture of bebop improvisation. Creates flowing, horn-like quality. Requires stamina and harmonic knowledge to sustain over fast-changing harmonies.

#### Enclosures
Melodic technique surrounding a target note from above and below. Can be chromatic, diatonic, or mixed. Creates the angular, non-linear quality of bebop melody. See Appendix A for notation examples.

### F

#### Four-Beat Feel
All four beats of the bar felt equally, as opposed to two-beat feel (emphasis on 1 and 3). Characteristic of swing era and all jazz after. Created by walking bass and drummer's ride cymbal.

### I

#### ii-V-I Progression
The most common chord progression in jazz. In the key of C: Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7. Derived from classical harmony but central to jazz. Bebop and later styles reharmonize with extensions and alterations. Foundation for learning jazz harmony and improvisation.

### M

#### Modes
Seven-note scales derived from the major scale, each starting on a different degree:
- **Ionian**: Major scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B)
- **Dorian**: Minor with raised 6th (D-E-F-G-A-B-C)
- **Phrygian**: Minor with lowered 2nd (E-F-G-A-B-C-D)
- **Lydian**: Major with raised 4th (F-G-A-B-C-D-E)
- **Mixolydian**: Major with lowered 7th (G-A-B-C-D-E-F)
- **Aeolian**: Natural minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G)
- **Locrian**: Diminished (B-C-D-E-F-G-A)

Became the basis for modal jazz in the late 1950s-60s.

### R

#### Reharmonization
Substituting different chords for the original harmony while maintaining (or enhancing) the melodic structure. Bebop musicians frequently reharmonized standards, adding ii-V progressions and altered chords. Continues to be important improvisational and compositional technique.

#### Rhythm Changes
Chord progression from "I Got Rhythm" (Gershwin). See Appendix A for full progression. Hundreds of bebop tunes use these changes. Essential learning for jazz musicians.

#### Ride Cymbal Pattern
Drummer's time-keeping pattern on the ride cymbal, typically: "ding-ding-a-ding, ding-ding-a-ding" (swing rhythm on ride). Replaced bass drum as primary time-keeper in bebop. Creates lighter, more flexible swing feel.

### S

#### Scat Singing
Vocal improvisation using nonsense syllables instead of lyrics. Allows voice to function like an instrument. Popularized by Louis Armstrong, mastered by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and others.

#### Stride Piano
Left-hand piano technique where bass notes/octaves alternate with mid-register chords: bass (beats 1&3), chord (beats 2&4). Creates "striding" motion. Evolved from ragtime, prominent in swing era. Example: James P. Johnson, Fats Waller.

#### Swing Rhythm
The fundamental rhythmic feel of jazz: eighth notes played unevenly (long-short, roughly 2:1 ratio like a triplet). Creates propulsive, lilting quality. Not strictly quantifiable—internalized feel. Notated eighth notes are "swung" in performance.

#### Syncopation
Placing rhythmic emphasis on weak beats or offbeats rather than strong beats (1 and 3). Creates rhythmic tension and interest. Fundamental to all jazz, from ragtime through contemporary styles. Distinguishes jazz from much classical and popular music.

### T

#### Trading Fours/Eights
Soloists alternating 4-bar (or 8-bar) phrases with each other or with the drummer. Standard practice in bebop and later styles. Creates musical dialogue and builds excitement. Often happens during final choruses.

#### Tritone Substitution
Replacing a dominant chord with another dominant chord a tritone (3 whole steps/6 half steps) away. Example: Db7 substitutes for G7 (both resolving to C). Works because tritone (interval of 3 whole steps) is the same in both chords. Common in bebop and all modern jazz.

#### Twelve-Bar Blues
Standard blues form: 12 measures following harmonic pattern. Basic form in C:
```
| C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 |
| F7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
| G7 | F7 | C7 | C7 |
  (or G7 on bar 12 for turnaround)
```

Foundation of jazz. Infinite variations exist (bebop blues, jazz blues, minor blues).

#### Two-Beat Feel
Emphasis on beats 1 and 3 (rather than all four beats). Characteristic of New Orleans jazz and early swing. Bass typically plays on 1 and 3, creating bouncing quality. Contrast with four-beat feel of mature swing and later styles.

### U

#### Upper Structure Triads
Triads built on upper extensions of chords. Example: Over Cmaj9, play an Em triad (E-G-B) = the 3rd, 5th, and 7th of Cmaj7. Creates rich voicings. Common in bebop and later piano and horn voicings.

### V

#### Vocalese
Adding lyrics to existing instrumental jazz solos. Requires singing complex bebop or later lines with words. Pioneered by Eddie Jefferson, popularized by Lambert, Hendricks & Ross. Example: Jon Hendricks's lyrics to famous solos.

### W

#### Walking Bass
Bass line that:
- Plays all four quarter notes per measure
- Outlines chord changes
- Creates smooth voice leading
- Propels the rhythm forward

Standard in swing and all jazz after. Creates the four-beat feel essential to jazz rhythm.

## Appendix E: Practice Suggestions

### For All Musicians: Universal Approaches

**1. Transcription**
The single most important learning tool in jazz:
- Start with short phrases or licks
- Progress to full solos
- Sing what you're transcribing (internalize it)
- Analyze what you transcribe (what scales, what harmony?)
- Transpose to all keys
- Integrate vocabulary into your playing

**Suggested First Transcriptions by Era**:
- Ragtime: Right-hand phrases from "Maple Leaf Rag"
- New Orleans: Louis Armstrong's "Potato Head Blues" breaks
- Swing: Lester Young's solo on "Lester Leaps In"
- Bebop: Charlie Parker's "Now's the Time" (blues)
- Cool: Miles Davis on "Move"
- Hard Bop: Clifford Brown on "Jordu"

**2. Playing Along with Recordings**
- Start with slower tempos
- Play melody/head first (learn the composition)
- Try to match articulation, phrasing, time feel
- Improvise along during solo sections
- Don't worry about playing "right" notes initially—develop time and feel

**3. Standards Study**
Learn the Great American Songbook:
- Start with: "Autumn Leaves," "All the Things You Are," "Stella by Starlight"
- Learn melody, then chord changes
- Practice in multiple keys
- Study different artists' interpretations
